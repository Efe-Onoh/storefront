## Development project

Task 1 can be accessed at: /
Task 2 can be accessed at: /devices

The project utilized HTML, SASS, JS, React, and Material Ui to implement the given designs. The project also makes use of react-router for client-side routing.
The focus was on implementing new and different features as opposed to the repetition of already existing features due to time.

Task 1 is largely more responsive compared to Task 2. However, making Task 2 responsive would require less effort than Task 1 in my opinion.

Interactivity has been added around both pages.
